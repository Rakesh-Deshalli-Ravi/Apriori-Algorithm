# Apriori-Algorithm
This repo contains a from-scratch implementation of the Apriori in Python. The code demonstrates concepts including frequent itemset generation, association rule mining, and confidence calculations. 


# Apriori Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm built from scratch. The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts behind association rule mining and frequent itemset generation.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Candidate itemset generation
- Frequent itemset mining
- Association rule extraction
- Support and confidence calculations

## Files

- `Apriori.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and examples

## Usage

To use this implementation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `Apriori.ipynb` Jupyter notebook
3. Run the cells to see the Apriori algorithm in action

## Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:

- How the Apriori algorithm works for frequent itemset mining
- The process of generating association rules
- Concepts of support, confidence, and lift in association analysis

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
